# cookiecutter-django-iot
Cookiecutter template for IoT projects using Django (with celery and Heroku support)

Forked from [aschn/cookiecutter-django-iot.git](https://github.com/aschn/cookiecutter-django-iot.git)

# Description

This cookiecutter template is a great place to start if you're building a Django app to monitor and control third-party Internet of Things devices through their APIs. It was originally assembled to accompany Anna Schneider's talk on Django for IoT at DjangoCon Europe 2016 ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/aschn/django-for-internet-of-things-from-hackathon-to-production), [video](https://opbeat.com/events/djangocon-eu-2016#iot-with-django-from-hackathon-to-production)).

Features:
* Django 2.2.5
* Bootstrap 3
* Celery 3.1
* Heroku compatible
* data model (including admin pages) for `Device`, `Attribute` (numerical observations with units), and `PowerStatus` (boolean observation of on/off status)
* placeholder tasks to interact with devices (`pull_attributes`, `set_status`, etc) **<- only code you might have to write!!**
* management commands to run tasks on the command line (or via Heroku Scheduler, cron, etc)
* celery infrastructure to schedule and run periodic background tasks
* test suite to jumpstart your TDD

# Quickstart
